# Acme Cloud Support Policy
Acme Cloud sells hosting plans to small teams. This document explains refunds, uptime, support hours, and what to do when an install fails. Read it once and keep the link.
## Refunds
You can ask for a refund on a monthly plan within 30 days of your first payment. Annual plans have a shorter window. You can ask for a refund on an annual plan within 14 days of payment. After that window closes, we do not refund the remaining months, but you can cancel and keep access until the plan ends.
Every refund request must include your invoice number. Requests without an invoice number are paused until you send it. Once we have everything, we send the money back to the original payment method within 7 business days. Bank transfers can take longer because the bank sets its own pace.
## Uptime Promise
Acme Cloud promises 99.9% uptime each month for paid plans. That is about 43 minutes of downtime in a 30 day month. If we miss the promise, you receive a credit on your next invoice. The credit is 10% of the monthly fee for each full hour of downtime above the limit, up to 100% of the fee.
Planned maintenance does not count as downtime when we announce it at least 48 hours ahead. We announce it on the status page and by email. Maintenance windows run between 02:00 and 04:00 UTC.
## Support Hours
Our support team answers tickets from Monday to Friday, 09:00 to 18:00 IST. On weekends, support is open from 10:00 to 16:00 IST for urgent tickets only. An urgent ticket means your site is fully down. Questions about billing wait until Monday.
Replies on the free plan can take up to 2 business days. Paid plans get a first reply within 4 hours during support hours.
## Installer Errors
Sometimes the desktop installer stops with a code instead of a message. Error code 0x80070005 means access is denied. Run the installer as an administrator and try again. If the code returns, check that your antivirus is not blocking the Acme folder.
Error code 0x80070057 means a setting is wrong. Open the installer log, find the line that starts with ARG, and send us that line. Do not send the whole log, because it can contain private paths.
## Account Deletion
You can delete your account from the Settings page. Deletion removes your sites, your backups, and your invoices from our servers within 30 days. We keep a record that the account existed, but nothing inside it. This cannot be undone, so download your backups first.
